## About:
Hey there! I'm Govind S Nair, and I'm thrilled to showcase my portfolio built with React. Developed with the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kg0z1qNrkw&t">Code Commerce's tutorial</a>, this is my first venture into using Tailwind CSS. It's been an incredible learning experience, exploring the possibilities that Tailwind CSS offers for creating stunning interfaces.

Within this webpage, you'll find details about me, including my skills, experience, and a way to get in touch with me. I've also included a collection of my projects, which highlight my expertise and creativity. Furthermore, the website is hosted on Netlify, and you can conveniently access it through the link provided in the repository description.

## Features:
1. Mobile and desktop responsive layout for optimal viewing on various devices.
2. Navbar for easy navigation and improved user interface, allowing users to access different sections easily.
3. Different sections on the single webpage: About, Contact, Home, Skills and Work.
4. Smooth scroll implemented using React for a seamless user experience while navigating between sections.
5. Eye-catching design with Tailwind CSS for a visually pleasing user experience.
6. Integrated Getforms.io for efficient form handling on the Contact section.
7. Developed using Yarn as the package manager for dependency management and project building.
8. Custom favicon for a unique and recognizable website icon in browser tabs.
